    <b>Water resources are natural resources of water </b>that are potentially useful as a source of water supply.<b> 97% of the water on the Earth is salt water and only three percent is fresh water; slightly over two thirds of this is frozen in glaciers and polar ice caps.</b> The remaining<b> unfrozen freshwater is found mainly as groundwater</b>, with only a small fraction present above ground or in the air. 
      <br>
      <br>
      Natural sources of fresh water include <b>surface water, under river flow, groundwater and frozen water. Artificial sources of fresh water can include treated wastewater (reclaimed water) and desalinated seawater.</b>
<br><br>
<b>Uses</b> of water <b>include agricultural, industrial, household, recreational and environmental activities.</b>
<b> Water resources are under threat from water scarcity, water pollution, water conflict and climate change. Fresh water is a renewable resource,</b> yet the<b> world's supply of groundwater is steadily decreasing,</b> with depletion occurring most prominently in Asia, South America and North America, although it is still unclear how much natural renewal balances this usage, and whether<b> ecosystems are threatened.</b> The framework for allocating water resources to water users (where such a framework exists) is known as water rights.

<h2 style="font-size: 40px;font-family: Georgia;">Sources Of Water</h2>  
<h4 style="font-size: 40px;font-family: Georgia;">Natural Sources Of Water</h4>  
<ul class="a">
  <li>
  <b>Surface Water</b> : Surface water is water in a<b> river, lake or fresh water wetland.</b> Surface water is naturally replenished by precipitation and naturally lost<b> through discharge to the oceans, evaporation, evapotranspiration and groundwater recharge.</b>
  </li>
  <br>
  <li>
  <b>Under river flow</b> : Throughout the course of a river,<b> the total volume of water</b> transported downstream will often be a combination of the visible free water flow </b>together with a substantial contribution flowing through rocks and sediments that <b>underlie the river and its floodplain called the hyporheic zone.</b>
  </li>
  <br>
  <li>
  <b>Ground Water</b> : Groundwater is <b>fresh water located in the subsurface pore space of soil and rocks</b>. It is also water that is flowing within aquifers below the water table. Sometimes it is useful to make a distinction between <b>groundwater that is closely associated with surface water and deep groundwater in an aquifer (sometimes called "fossil water").</b>
  </li>
  <br>
  <li>
  <b>Frozen Water </b>: Several schemes have been <b>proposed to make use of icebergs as a water source,</b> however to date this has only been done for research purposes. <b>Glacier runoff is considered to be surface water.</b>
  </li>
  </ul>
  <h4 style="font-size: 40px;font-family: Georgia;">Artificial Sources Of Water</h4>  
<ul class="a">
  <li>
  <b>Reclaimed water</b> : Water reclamation <b>(also called wastewater reuse) </b>is the process of converting municipal wastewater (sewage) or industrial wastewater into water that can be reused for a variety of purposes. Types of <b>reuse include: urban reuse, agricultural reuse (irrigation), environmental reuse, industrial reuse, planned potable reuse, de facto wastewater reuse (unplanned potable reuse). </b>
  </li>
  <br>
  <li>
  <b>Desalination</b> : Desalination is a <b>process that takes away mineral components from saline water. More generally, desalination refers to the removal of salts and minerals from a target substance,</b> as in soil desalination, which is an issue for agriculture.<b> Saltwater (especially sea water) is desalinated to produce water suitable for human consumption</b> or irrigation. The by-product of the desalination process is brine
  </li>
  </ul>
