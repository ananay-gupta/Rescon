     A renewable resource, also known as a flow resource, <b>is a natural resource which will replenish to replace the portion depleted by usage and consumption,</b> either through natural reproduction or other recurring processes in a finite amount of time in a human time scale. <b>When such recovery rate of resources is unlikely to ever exceed a human time scale, these are called perpetual resources.</b>
     <br>
     <br>
      Renewable resources are a part of Earth's natural environment and <b>the largest components of its ecosphere. </b>A positive life-cycle assessment is a key indicator of a resource's sustainability.
      <br>
      <br>
      A type of renewable resources is renewable energy resources. Common sources of<b> renewable energy include solar, geothermal and wind power, </b>which are all categorized as renewable resources. <b>Fresh water is an example of renewable resources.</b>

 <img src="images/renewtype1.jpg" width="600px" height="300px"  style="float:right;margin-left:20px;top: 0; padding-right: 20px;padding-top: 20px;" >
 <br>

 Renewable energy refers to the<b> provision of energy via renewable resources</b> which are naturally replenished fast enough as being used. It includes e.g. <b>sunlight, wind, biomass, rain, tides, waves and geothermal heat.</b>
<br><br><br>

 <h4 style="font-size: 40px;font-family: Georgia;">BioMass</h4> 

 Biomass is referring to <b>biological material from living, or recently living organisms, </b>most often referring to plants or plant-derived materials.

<h4 style="font-size: 40px;font-family: Georgia;">BioFuel</h4> 

A biofuel is a type of fuel whose energy is <b>derived from biological carbon fixation.</b> Biofuels include fuels derived from biomass conversion, as well as <b>solid biomass, liquid fuels and various biogases</b>.

<b>Bioethanol is an alcohol made by fermentation,</b> mostly from carbohydrates produced in sugar or starch crops such as corn, sugarcane or switchgrass.

<h4 style="font-size: 40px;font-family: Georgia;">Geothermal Energy</h4> 

Geothermal energy is the <b>thermal energy in the Earth's crust</b> which originates from the formation of the planet and <b>from radioactive decay of materials in currently uncertain</b> but possibly roughly equal proportions. <b>The high temperature and pressure in Earth's interior cause some rock to melt and solid mantle to behave plastically</b>, resulting in parts of the mantle convecting upward since it is lighter than the surrounding rock and <b>temperatures at the core mantle boundary can reach over 4000 degree celsius.</b>

<h4 style="font-size: 40px;font-family: Georgia;">Hydropower Energy</h4> 

Hydropower, also known as water power, is the <b>use of falling or fast-running water to produce electricity or to power machines.</b> This is achieved by converting the kinetic energy of water into electrical or mechanical energy. <b>Hydropower is a form of sustainable energy production.</b>
<h4 style="font-size: 40px;font-family: Georgia;">Solar Energy</h4> 

Solar power is <b>energy from the sun that is converted into thermal or electrical energy.</b> Solar technologies can harness this energy for a variety of<b> uses, including generating electricity, providing light or a comfortable interior environment,</b> and heating water for domestic, commercial, or industrial use.

<h4 style="font-size: 40px;font-family: Georgia;">Wind Energy</h4> 
Wind energy is a form of solar energy. Wind energy (or wind power) describes the <b>process by which wind is used to generate electricity. Wind turbines convert the kinetic energy in the wind into mechanical power. </b>














<h2 style="font-size: 40px;font-family: Georgia;">Non Renewable Energy Resources</h2>
<img src="images/nonrenew1.jpg" width="55%"  style="float:left;margin-left:0;top: 0; padding-right: 20px;padding-top: 20px;" >
<br>
A non-renewable resource (also called a <b>finite resource</b>) is a natural resource that<b> cannot be readily replaced by natural means at a pace quick enough to keep up with consumption.</b> An example is carbon-based <b>fossil fuels.</b> The original organic matter, with the aid of heat and pressure, becomes a fuel such as oil or gas. <b>Earth minerals and metal ores, fossil fuels (coal, petroleum, natural gas) and groundwater in certain aquifers</b> are all considered non-renewable resources, though<b> individual elements are always conserved (except in nuclear reactions).</b>

Conversely,<b> resources such as timber</b> (when harvested sustainably) <b>and wind </b>(used to power energy conversion systems) <b>are considered renewable resources,</b> largely because their localized replenishment can occur within time frames meaningful to humans as well.
<br>
<br>
The following demographs demonstrates the <b> Non Renewable Resources</b>:

<img src="images/nonrenewgraph2.png" width="600px" height="400px"  style="float:right;margin-left:20px;top: 0; padding-right: 20px;padding-top: 20px;" >

<h2 style="font-size: 40px;font-family: Georgia;">'Types Of Non Renewable Energy'</h2> 

 <img src="images/nonrenewtype1.jpg" width="600px" height="300px"  style="float:right;margin-left:20px;top: 0; padding-right: 20px;padding-top: 20px;" >
 <br>

 There are four major <b>types of nonrenewable resources: oil, natural gas, coal, and nuclear energy.</b> Oil, natural gas, and coal are collectively called fossil fuels. <b>Fossil fuels </b>were formed within the Earth <b>from dead plants and animals over millions of years</b> hence the name 'fossil' fuels.

<br><br><br>

<h4 style="font-size: 40px;font-family: Georgia;">Earth minerals and metal ores</h4> 

Earth minerals and metal ores are examples of <b>non-renewable resources.</b> The metals themselves are present in vast amounts in Earth's crust, and their extraction by humans only occurs where they are concentrated by<b> natural geological processes (such as heat, pressure, organic activity, weathering and other processes) </b>enough to become <b>economically viable to extract.</b> These processes generally take from <b>tens of thousands to millions of years, through plate tectonics, tectonic subsidence and crustal recycling.</b>

<h4 style="font-size: 40px;font-family: Georgia;">Fossil fuels</h4>
Natural resources such as<b> coal, petroleum (crude oil) and natural gas</b> take thousands of years to <b>form naturally and cannot be replaced as fast as they are being consumed. </b>Eventually it is considered that fossil-based resources will become too costly to harvest and humanity will need to shift its reliance to other sources of energy such as solar or wind power, see renewable energy.
<br>
At present,<b> the main energy source used by humans is non-renewable fossil fuels.</b> Since the dawn of internal combustion engine technologies in the 19th century, <b>petroleum and other fossil fue</b>ls have remained <b>in continual demand.</b> As a result, conventional infrastructure and transport systems, which are fitted to combustion engines, remain prominent throughout the globe.

<h4 style="font-size: 40px;font-family: Georgia;">Nuclear fuels</h4> 
<b>Nuclear power provides about 6% of the world's energy and 13 to 14% of the world's electricity.</b> Nuclear energy production is associated with <b>potentially dangerous radioactive contamination</b> as it relies upon unstable elements. In particular, nuclear power facilities <b>produce about 200,000 metric tons of low and intermediate level waste <b>(LILW) and </b>10,000 metric tons of high level waste (HLW) </b>(including spent fuel designated as waste) each year worldwide.
